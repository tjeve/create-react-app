# Contacts App
This is an app that uses React and allows you to add and edit contacts then displays them.

## Setup
* Use create-react-app to create a React app. Remove boilerplate as needed.
## Add Contact Form
* Create an add contact form with the following fields: name, e-mail, phone number, address, city, state, and zip code
* When "added" the contact should show up in a list below the add form.
## Contact List
* Create some initial data that will always populate your list on reload.
* The contact list should always be sorted in alphabetical order by name.
* The initial view of the list should only show the contact's name, city, and state.
* When clicked the contact's entire information should be displayed.
## Editing and Deleting
* Create a way to delete contacts.
* Create a way to edit contacts. Try to reuse your add form in some way so you don't have to create two different forms.
## Bonus: Favorites
* Add a way to mark contacts as your favorite
* Add a way to just see favorites and hide the others
## Bonus: Search
* Add a search box above your contact list.
* When typing use the entered text to filter down the list of contacts shown.
* The search should search through all field values.
